# The FUSE mount(s) /run/user/*/gvfs are inaccessible to root and thereby
# cause systemd-tmpfiles --clean to spit an error to the system log upon
# it trying to stat these directories.
#
# While this FUSE behaviour might be considered a FUSE problem, solve this
# for now by telling systemd-tmpfiles to just stay out of /run/user/*.
#
# Note that more specifically telling it to stay out of /run/user/*/gvfs
# does not help since it'll still stat those directories when traversing
# /run/user/*.
